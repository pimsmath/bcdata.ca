|---------|-----------------|------------|
| 1 | A risk-based platform for accident prevention strategies | BC Safety Authority’s accident prevention strategy follows a risk based platform, called “bow tie” for ongoing management and prevention of major incidents. The bow tie method draws on the direct experience of safety management team and the data collected from various safety oversight programs in order to identify hazards and to properly incorporate critical controls into management systems. In addition, it raises awareness and improves understanding and risk knowledge of the potential major incidents and the reliance on critical controls that prevent those accidents from occurring.  Opportunities exist for greater connectivity among various databases to maximize the risk knowledge, especially the pre incident data based on inspections and post incident data. |
